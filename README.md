# Google-Clone
The goal with this project was to show my HTML and CSS skills by cloning a familiar web page.

This project allowed me to practice many CSS techniques and gauge my understanding of certain CSS concepts I have been learning over my first month as a self-taught developer.

At this point of time, I didn't know how to include fonts from other sources, so I made the Google logo from scratch. I have seen others just copy a logo image, but I thought it would be good practice to make myself with CSS.

I tried to implement a lot of the current Google page's functionality including an input search bar and a navigation bar with items that have hover effects.
